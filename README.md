In this project, we applied multiple regression into the research on startup companiesâ€™ performance based on their profitability. Multiple regression is a type of supervised learning. We measured the performance of a startup company by predicting its profit, based on Research and Development Spending, Marketing spending, State and Administrative Costs. We clean and encode categorical data in the data processing stage, fit the data on the multiple linear regression model and perform lasso in the data analysis stage to perform feature selection. After training the model we deployed our model on test data and gave us a 98% accuracy, hence we concluded that multiple regression is a good fit on predicting the profit of startup companies. It could be established that companies that spend more on Marketing and Research and Development experienced a high return on profitability level.
